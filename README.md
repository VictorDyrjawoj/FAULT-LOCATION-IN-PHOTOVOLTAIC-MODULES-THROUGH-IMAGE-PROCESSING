# FAULT-LOCATION-IN-PHOTOVOLTAIC-MODULES-THROUGH-IMAGE-PROCESSING
This repository is part of my collegue's work and mater's thesis. You will find the images collected and the code that I used for the papers.
The final code will be published when the Master's Thesis is completed. Part of the comments in the code are in Portugueses, but after the conclusion of the work, I will 
correct them. So far, there are the images, annotations and the code for image detection/instance segmentation.
